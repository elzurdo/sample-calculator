   We find that understanding how to draw conclusions from a sample üî¨, assists budgeting for the required

    When interpreting audit results üî¨ these calculators can assess the answers the following: 
    * üìê Determining Accuracy: *"How well does the model perform"?* 
    * ‚õë Ensuring Value Clearance: *"Does the model perform better than value X?"* 
    * ‚öñÔ∏è Model Comparison: *"Is the model performing better than a previous?"*
